Now it's time to collect the clues! The officers on the scene are pretty meticulous, so they've written down EVERYTHING in their officer reports. Take a look at the 'mystery/crimescene' file. It's quite large so use the `less` command to view the contents of the file, one screen at a time.

What is the difference between absolute paths and relative paths?
Answer: The difference between relative and absolute paths is that when using relative paths you take as reference the current working directory while with absolute paths you refer to a certain, well known directory. Relative paths are useful when you make some program that has to use resources from certain folders that can be opened using the working directory as a starting point.

Examples:
Absolute path: ..\images\image2.jpg
Relative path: ./image.pn

You need to search for lines in the file marked with the word 'CLUE'. Use the `grep` command to do this.

Once you've found all the clues it's time to save them to a separate file for future reference.

Use `touch` to create a file named 'clues.txt'. Use `>` to save the output of the `grep` command to the 'clues.txt' file.

That's the first step done! Open 'step1-git' to see how you can track your work using a version control system (git).
